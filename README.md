# Standing-Waves-Demonstration
GUI written in Java that demonstrates the various aspects of Standing Waves with animations

Note: Robert Hart of Southern Methodist University created the original applet (which he based off of another applet created by Walter Fendt). My version of this applet includes the graphs of the potential and kinetic energies. I also changed some of the style of the applet to be more visually stimulating.
