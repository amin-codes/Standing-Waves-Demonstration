# Standing-Waves-Demonstration
Stand-alone GUI written in Java that demonstrates the various aspects of Standing Waves with animations. I made this for my final project in my AP Physics 1 class. Also, my former teacher now uses this project as part of his teaching. 

You can download the released version (which can be seen on the right side of the screen) and play with the simulator for yourself or just look at the images below.

Note: Robert Hart of Southern Methodist University created the original applet (which he based off of another applet created by Walter Fendt). My version of this applet includes the graphs of the potential and kinetic energies. I also changed some of the style of the applet to be more visually stimulating.
